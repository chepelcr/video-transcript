# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Current Issue: "You need to join the team to see this project"

This error indicates the GitHub Pages deployment isn't properly configured. Follow these steps:

### 1. Repository Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the settings

### 2. Verify Workflow Permissions
1. In repository Settings > **Actions** > **General**
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, select **Read and write permissions**
3. Check **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**
4. Save changes

### 3. Trigger Deployment
1. Push any change to the `main` branch
2. Go to **Actions** tab to watch the workflow
3. Wait for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" to complete
4. Check the workflow output for the deployment URL

### 4. Expected URLs After Deployment
- Main site: `https://jcampos.dev/video-transcript/`
- English: `https://jcampos.dev/video-transcript/en`
- Spanish: `https://jcampos.dev/video-transcript/es`
- Debug mode: `https://jcampos.dev/video-transcript/?debug=true`

### 5. Troubleshooting
If the error persists:
1. Check if the repository is public (GitHub Pages free requires public repo)
2. Verify the workflow ran successfully in Actions tab
3. Check the Pages settings show a green checkmark
4. Try the debug URL to see detailed error information

### 6. Current Configuration
- ✅ Subdirectory deployment configured (`/video-transcript/`)
- ✅ Asset paths automatically fixed in build process
- ✅ SPA routing handled with 404.html redirects
- ✅ Language routing works with subdirectory
- ✅ Favicon and debug logging added

The routing logic is correct - the issue is that GitHub Pages isn't deployed yet.
