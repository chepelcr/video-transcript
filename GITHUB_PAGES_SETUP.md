# GitHub Pages Setup - REQUIRED STEPS

## Current Status: NOT DEPLOYED
The 404 error shows GitHub Pages isn't configured for this repository yet.

## STEP 1: Repository Settings (CRITICAL)
1. Go to this repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab (top of repository)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (not Branch)
5. Click **Save**

## STEP 2: Repository Visibility
- Repository MUST be **PUBLIC** for free GitHub Pages
- If private, upgrade to GitHub Pro or make repository public

## STEP 3: Trigger Deployment
After settings are configured:
1. Push any change to `main` branch, OR
2. Go to **Actions** tab > **Deploy to GitHub Pages** > **Run workflow**

## STEP 4: Monitor Deployment
1. Check **Actions** tab for workflow progress
2. Wait for green checkmark on "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Deployment URL will appear in workflow output

## Expected Result
After successful deployment:
- ✅ `https://video-transcript.jcampos.dev/` (English)
- ✅ `https://video-transcript.jcampos.dev/es` (Spanish) 
- ✅ `https://video-transcript.jcampos.dev/en` (English explicit)

## Current Configuration Status
- ✅ Workflow file exists (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Permissions configured correctly
- ✅ Asset paths configured for custom domain
- ✅ SPA routing configured
- ❌ **Repository Pages not enabled** ← THIS IS THE ISSUE

## If Still Getting 404 After Setup
1. Check if workflow ran successfully in Actions tab
2. Verify Pages source is "GitHub Actions" not "Branch"  
3. Ensure repository is public
4. Try manual workflow trigger
5. Check workflow logs for errors

The routing code is correct - the issue is GitHub Pages isn't deployed.
